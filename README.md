# waffer  ( WRITING THE README.md)

A lightweight Web Application Firewall (Waf) detection utility for passive and conservative active fingerprinting.

Warning: This project is for educational and defensive use only. Do not run active tests against systems you do not own or do not have explicit authorization to test.

Features

Passive fingerprinting using HTTP headers, cookies, status codes and response body patterns.

Optional conservative active tests (disabled by default) to increase detection confidence. ( WORKING ON IT )


Passive detection (normal GET/HEAD requests) is low risk but still generates traffic â€” respect robots.txt and rate limits.

This project is intended for security professionals, developers and researchers.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Suggested ways to help:

Add more reliable fingerprints (headers/cookies/body/status) for additional Waf vendors.

Improve scoring and reduce false positives.

Add async support with httpx and asyncio for scanning many targets.

Add unit tests and CI (GitHub Actions).

When contributing, please include tests for new fingerprints or behaviors.
